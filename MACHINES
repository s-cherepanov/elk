Sun-3 and Sun-4, SunOS 4.1

   o  Tested with /bin/cc, various gcc versions, and with the Sun
      SPARCompiler 2.0.1 (acc).

   o  For compiling Elk with gcc and the generational garbage collector,
      see the remark in the file BUGS.

   o  Dumped executables created on a Sun-4m (SPARCstation 10 or
      SPARCstation 600) do not run on other Sun-4 architectures and
      vice versa.


Sun-4, SunOS 5.2 (Solaris 2.2)

   o  Tested with various gcc versions and with ANSI SPARCompiler 2.0.1.
      If you have gcc, however, you should use it rather than the Sun
      compiler.  gcc produces much faster code.

   o  The Motif extension has been tested with both vanilla OSF Motif 1.2
      as well as Sun's version of Motif (which usually lives in /usr/dt).
      The X11 extensions have been tested with OpenWindows in addition
      to X Consortium X11R6.

   o  Certain versions of gcc complain about syntax errors in code that
      uses sigset_t (from <signal.h>), although this should not happen
      unless -ansi is given.  A possible fix is to add add -D__STDC__=0
      to the cflags in the config file.

   o  "dump" works, but it doesn't know anything about shared objects
      (the dl library doesn't support a way to get hold of the text and
      data segments of dlopen()ed shared objects).  Thus it's a bad idea
      to invoke "dump" if any object files have been loaded into the
      interpreter.

   o  Dynamic loading is based on the dlopen() function of the "dl"
      library.  Here is a short overview of the implementation of
      dlopen-based dynamic loading:
   
         To load an object file, the linker is called by the interpreter
         to produce a shared object from the .o file.  This shared object
	 is then loaded by means of dlopen().

         To allow object files to reference symbols defined by object
         files loaded earlier (the standard dynamic loading semantics
         of Elk), the interpreter keeps tmp the output files (shared
         objects) of all previous linker invocations in /tmp and uses
	 these as input to a each linker invocation.  As a result, one
	 new temp file is created each time an object file is loaded.

         As the linker combines dynamically loadable object files and
         (optional) libraries into shared objects, all dynamically loadable
         files must have been compiled with -fpic or -K PIC (to create
	 position independent code).  Also, all involved libraries must
	 either be shared libraries or must contain position independent
	 code as well.  For example, if you want to use the Motif extension,
	 your Xm library must have been compiled with -fpic.

         A bug in Solaris 2.1 causes dlopen() to fail if more than
         8 shared objects are loaded (which in turn causes the "load"
         primitive of Elk to signal an error).  This restriction doesn't
         exist in newer versions of Solaris 2.

         You can use the -v option of Elk to see the actual linker options
         when an object file is loaded.


DECstation 5100, Ultrix 4.2

   o  Prototypes have been disabled in the config file, as cc has trouble
      with certain forms of prototype declarations (this looks like a bug).

   o  The LDFLAGS "-Wl,-D,800000" are required for dynamic loading to work.

   o  You have to create "-G 0" versions of all X libraries to be able to
      dynamically load the X11 extensions of Elk (the MIPS linker requires
      this).


DEC/Alpha, OSF/1

   o  This platform uses ELF and the dlopen()-style linker interface.
      See the section on Solaris 2 above for remarks on dynamic loading.


SGI IRIS Indy, Irix 5.3

   o  See SunOS 5.x above for information about dynamic loading and dump.

   o  examples/unix/calc.scm doesn't work, because /usr/bin/dc uses
      buffered output if stdout is not a terminal.

   o  For Irix 5.2, -lSM and -lICE must be removed from the libx*
      definitions in config/site (the X11 version seems to be X11R5).


HP 9000/700, HP-UX 9.0 and HP-UX 10.0

   o  Dynamic loading is based on the shl_load() interface to the dynamic
      linker of HP-UX.  If you are writing your own extensions, compile
      them with the option +z and use $install_dir/lib/makedl to link them.
      The load-libraries are simply shl_loaded before the files passed to
      the "load" primitives.  Each load-library is only loaded once.

   o  wait3 has been set to `no' in the system file, because this function
      has a non-standard third argument in HP-UX 9.0.

   o  The "dump" implementation for HP-UX which used to work well under
      HP-UX 8.x doesn't really work any longer, because HP in their
      infinite wisdom have removed the MAP_REPLACE flag for mmap() in
      HP-UX 9.x.

   o  HP-UX 10 does have a stack-extending alloca() (in contrast to
      HP-UX 9.0), but it has a serious bug and therefore is not used
      by Elk (the function overwrites its argument if it is a register
      variable).

   o  The incremental garbage collector doesn't work (see the file BUGS).

   o  The Athena widgets are not included with HP-UX 9.0; delete "lib/xaw"
      from the Makefile.

   o  You may want to use the HP-UX site file from config/sites.


IBM RS/6000, AIX 3.2

   o  Neither "dump" nor dynamic loading work.  It is not clear whether
      the dynamic loading semantics of Elk can be implemented with the
      dynamic linker interface of AIX at all.

   o  To support linking the interpreter with extensions statically,
      you *have* to use the $install_dir/lib/linkscheme shell script;
      it contains special code to build an `export list' to prevent
      the AIX linker from `garbage collecting' the extensions.

   o  -O has been omitted from the CFLAGS, as the optimizer seems to
      have bugs.


PowerPC, AIX 4.1 (xlc and gcc)

   o  No dynamic loading, no dump (see AIX 3.2 above).

   o  The incremental garbage collector doesn't work (see the file BUGS).

   o  If you are using gcc, and if your gcc uses the AIX linker, the
      linker prints tons of bogus messages about duplicate symbols; they
      can be ignored safely.  You may also have to change the `*-aix4*-cc'
      in the shell script `linkscheme' into `*-aix4*-gcc' to enable the
      hack involving the linker export list.


NeXT workstation, MACH/NeXT-OS 3.3

   o  Dynamic loading is implemented by means of the rld_load() library
      function.  Due to what looks like a bug in rld_load(), it only
      works sometimes.  In particular, it is not possible to load the
      UNIX extension.

      The source of the problem seems to be that sometimes the string table
      of the newly loaded object file gets truncated when being mapped into
      memory by rld_load().  You can observe the problem by inserting a
      statement like "write(1, strtab, sym_cmd->strsize);" right after
      the line beginning with "strtab =" in src/stab-macho.c.

   o  Linking extensions statically with the interpreter doesn't work
      either; there are no symbols in the symbol table when it is read
      on startup of the executable.  This seems to be related to the
      bug described above.
      
      These two problems render Elk virtually unusable on the NeXT.


386/486-PC, Linux 1.2.8

   o  Dynamic loading does not work any longer, because the linker has
      changed.  It doesn't seem to support incremental loading any more
      at all.  dlopen() seems to exist now, but how does one create
      a shared object from an ordinary .o file?  Someone who knows
      Linux well may want to look into this...

   o  `dump' doesn't work either.  It did work in earlier Linux versions.

   o  Because of a bug in `make', all Makefiles had to be changed to
      explicitly run the shell for invoking the `build' shell scripts.

   o  examples/unix/calc.scm doesn't work, because /usr/bin/dc uses
      buffered output if stdout is not a terminal.


386/486-PC, 32-bit gcc (DJGPP) and `go32' DOS extender

    o  Elk 3.0 has not been tested on this platform.

    o  As the typical DOS machine doesn't have a fully functional UNIX
       shell, sed, etc., you have to cross-localize the source tree on a
       UNIX machine (i.e. create all the localized Makefiles, create
       include/config.h, etc.).  To do so, just copy the DOS config file
       to config/system (or make a link), edit config/site, and call

          make localized.zip

       This cleans the source tree, performs the necessary localizations,
       and packages a minimal distribution into a zip file.  You can
       then FTP the zip file to the DOS machine and run `make' there.
       The zip file basically contains the interpreter sources, the Scheme
       files needed at runtime, the extensions in lib/misc, and the
       localized Makefiles and include files.

    o  There are a few trouble spots you should watch out for.  Some versions
       of `make' under DOS (Ndmake?) can't handle the macro $(MAKE) that
       is defined at the beginning of all Makefiles.  If this is the case
       on your system, forget the Makefiles and run "make -f Makefile.local"
       in each directory.  You may have to replace $(O) in src/Makefile.local
       by *.o to avoid command lines that are too long for the DOS shell.
       You have to delete the line beginning with "../../scripts/makedl"
       in misc/Makefile.local.


X Window System

   o  You need either X11R4, X11R5, X11R6, or (on Suns) OpenWindows 3.x to
      use the Elk/X11 extensions.  The current release of Elk has been
      tested with X11R6 and OpenWindows.

      If you are still running X11R4, edit the file lib/xaw/build and
      remove the lines referring to the Athena widgets that are new in
      X11R5 (panner, porthole, repeater, and tree).

      If you are running X11R5 or older, you may want to edit lib/xaw/build
      and add lines for the `clock' widget.  Also, remove -lSM and -lICE
      from the definitions in config/site.  examples/xaw/porthole.scm
      and examples/xaw/viewport.scm don't work with X11R6, as they are
      using the clock widget which doesn't exist any longer.


Motif Widgets

   o  You need at least Motif 1.1 to use the Elk/Motif extension.
      The current release of Elk has been tested with OSF/Motif 1.2
      and, under Solaris 2.4, with Sun Motif (/usr/dt).

      Make sure that X11 has been compiled with the symbol MotifBC set
      to YES in site.def.
